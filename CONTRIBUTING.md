# Contributing

TL;DR:
  1. Pull requests welcome
  2. Please use the `develop` branch . Use the fork & PR model
  3. The `main` branch is protected and will be used to merge in new things from the `develop` branch
  4. Make sure, you have unit tests

Thank you ❤️ for contributing! Let's make this a great CTI summarization tool.

## What are we currently looking for?

* Take a look at [the issues](https://github.com/aaronkaplan/openai-cti-summarizer/issues)
* Overall goal for version 2:
   - change everything to use langchain
   - allow for local LLMs (llama-2-70b or similar) in addition to  MS Azure's OpenAI (middle level of sensitivity) or openAI's API (TLP:CLEAR)
   - promptsDB
   - enhance UI so that a few proposals get presented to the user. The user shall be able to select the best one and possibly edit the final result.
   - Automate QA control.
     
  Any help in these directions is much appreciated.
